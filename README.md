##### The Game of Ur AI: A Genetic Algorithm Approach

The Royal Game of Ur is the oldest board-game known, being around for almost 4,500 years. Being the original game that involves strategy and chance, we decided to determine how effective an AI algorithm can be for playing The Royal Game of Ur. 



## Approach

Using a genetic algorithm approach, for each **agent**, we specified various *genes* involving float values which are later multiplied by the respective state evaluation variables to determine the "fitness" of each possible moves. The agent then chooses to perform the move with the highest fitness value. A **generation** is composed of 20 different agents, where each agent plays 50 games against another agent and their results are recorded. For each generation, 12 children are generated by applying crossover/mutation functions to 12 different pairs of agents of the current generation,  5 children are newly generated with random gene values, and 3 best performing agents of the current generation are chosen to survive. In total, these 20 agents compose the next generation of agents.



## Libraries

`NumPy` and `Matplotlib` are required to run this program



## Initial agent setup

Running `python3 createNewSeed.py` in `/agentFiles` directory creates 20 new initial agents that will be used as generation 1.



## Instructions

After setting up the initial agents, to generate only a FinalAgent with an auto-terminating process, run one of the following:

`python3 geneticCoEval.py`
`python3 geneticPastEval.py`
`python3 randomPastEval.py`

To create a FinalAgent and various plots including best observed winrate and gene values across a fixed 20 generations, run one of the following:

`python3 fixedGenerationsCoEval.py`
`python3 fixedGenerationsPastEval.py`
`python3 fixedGenerationsRandomEval.py`
